# Orionsangel Original Console - Mega Bezel Graphics and Presets

## Mega Bezel conversions of Orionsangel's original console overlays.

Orionsangel's console overlays were the inspiration for my own Mega Bezel graphics and presets, without his work my work would have never happened. I am eternally grateful for his contributions to the community, both past and present.

He has graciously allowed me the privilege of creating modern Mega Bezel presets using his graphics as a base.

I have not altered his graphics in any way. It is my hope that this will bring his work to a fresh audience, and breath some new life into his classic work.

I have created Advanced, Standard, Lite, and Potato versions of the presets and based them on a scaled down version of my 1.1.0.0 multiple reference boilerplate release.

An introduction to my boilerplate is in my Duimon-Mega-Bezel repo and will serve for this pack as well.

As time permits I will expand this Readme with some other notes and screenshots. I hope you enjoy this opportunity to experience Orionsangel's work in a new way.
